# Hybrid-cryptography using multiprocessing

Our objective is to create a hybrid cipher with higher entropy and increased throughput.

To engineer a new hybrid cipher,two robust and widely used algorithms AES-256 and Blowfish are used , to achieve faster speeds of encryption and decryption Multiprocessing feature in python is used.
